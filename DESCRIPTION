Description: The package obtains parameter estimation, i.e., maximum
    likelihood estimators (MLE), via the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
    algorithm for the Finite Mixture of Regression (FMR) models with Normal
    distribution, and MLE for the Finite Mixture of Accelerated Failure Time
    Regression (FMAFTR) subject to right censoring with Log-Normal and Weibull
    distributions via the EM algorithm and the Newton-Raphson algorithm (for
    Weibull distribution).
    More importantly, the package obtains the maximum penalized likelihood
    (MPLE) for both FMR and FMAFTR models (collectively called FMRs).
    A component-wise tuning parameter selection based on a component-wise BIC is
    implemented in the package.
    Furthermore, this package provides Ridge Regression and Elastic Net.
