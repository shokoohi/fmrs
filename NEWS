CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-7
----------------------
IMPROVEMENTS SINCE LAST TIME
    o We have implemented S4 classes and methods in this release.

CHANGES SINCE LAST TIME
    o Since S4 methods are implemented we have changed some arguments and
    definitions in this release.
    o fmrs object is changed to fmrsfit.
    o tunpar object is changed to fmrstunpar
    o You can no longer use $ to call the arguments of objects since they are
    written in S4 classes. You need to use @ instead or slot().
    o New methods added to the package (see the manual).

------------------------
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-6
----------------------
MINOR CHANGES SINCE LAST TIME
    o We have changed the name of the functions and classes so that it won't
    be mistaken with S3 and S4 methods and classes as follows.
    o fmrs.mel() changed to fmrmle()
    o fmrs.tunsel() changed to fmrstunsel()
    o fmrs.varsel() changed to fmrsvarsel()
    o fmrs.fit changed to fmrs.
    o fmrs.lambda changed to tunepar.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
    o We intend to make some refinements to the package by introducing better
    S4 classes and methods.
    o We will add more distributions to the package including Generalized Gamma
    and Gompertz.
    o Since we are working on length-biased models, these models will be added
    to the package.

BUG FIXES
    o None reported so far.
